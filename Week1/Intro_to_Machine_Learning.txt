** What is Machine Learning

    ** Arthur Samuel defined machine learning as the field of
       study that gives computers the ability to learn without
       being explicitly programmed.

    ** Samuel's claim to fame was that back in the 1950s, he wrote
       a checkers playing program. The amazing thing about this
       program was that Arthur Samuel himself wasn't a very good 
       checkers player.


** Types of Machine Learning

    ** The two main types of machine learning are supervised learning
       and unsupervised learning.

    ** Of these two, supervised learning is the type of machine
       learning that is used most in many real-world applications
       and has seen the most rapid advancements and innovation.
