** What is Supervised Machine Learning

    ** Supervised machine learning or more commonly, supervised
       learning, refers to algorithms that learn x to y or input
       to output mappings. The key characteristic of supervised
       learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples
       to learn from.

    ** Let say we're trying to predict a number from infinitely many
       possible numbers such as the house prices in our example,
       which could be 150,000 or 70,000 or 183,000 or any other
       number in between. That's supervised learning, learning input,
       output, or x to y mappings.
